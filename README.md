# Readme-Generator-

For this assignment we were to create a readme generator. Why is this incredibly useful?  A good readme is important to help other developers navigate through your app or website. 
As a developer you want to spend the bulk of your time focusing on your current project. The readme generator gives developers the ability to create good quality readmeâ€™s in no time.
